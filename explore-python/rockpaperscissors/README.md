# RockPaperScissors

<h3>Technologies Used: </h3>
<p>Python, Visual Studio Code, GitHub</p>

In this game, you (the user), plays rock paper scissors with the computer (the opponent).
The computer (the opponent) uses a random choice between rock, paper and scissors only to play against you (the user).
If both of you guess the same thing, then it's a tie and you have to play another round!
The rules for playing and ultimately winning are: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper and paper beats rock, so if you play right and hope the computer (opponent) picks a random choice that will let you win, then you win! Otherwise, you loose!
Have fun playing! :)
