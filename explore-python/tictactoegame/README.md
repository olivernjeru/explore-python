Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Canadian or Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

<p>A classic game that uses the Command Line Interface for the interaction between a human player and a random computer player to bring back that nostalgic feeling all of us probably had as a kid when playing computer games.</p>
<p>Implemented Object Oriented Programming with Python to create functions & methods within classes</p>
<p>Imported functions and classes from player.py file, that perform their designated roles, into game.py file to enable a human(you), to play with a random computer player to see who will have the better hand over the other.
