<p>The aim is to make you have fun as it works by asking you to enter a number of nouns, verbs, adjectives and pronouns and then fills them into a paragraph. You then go ahead and read the new paragraph and see if it makes sense or if it completely does not make sense. It does not make sense most of the time, lol XD</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
